# Cryptography
This course begin with the introduction to the general concept of cryptography including the security goals, security attacks, data concealing techniques and Hard Mathematical Problems. Students also will be exposed to the role of cryptography in computer security concept. After that, some mathematical techniques those needed in cryptography will be taught such as modular arithmetic, algebraic structure and prime numbers. The next topic is about the conventional type of cryptosystem covering the mono-alphabetic and poly-alphabetic ciphers. Modern cryptosystem such as RSA, El-Gamal, Rabin and Elliptic Curve cryptosystems will be introduced to the students in the next chapter. Some methods of security attacks also will be taught such as direct, exploiting an error and active attacks. The last topic in this course is Digital Signature. Variation and applications of Digital Signature will be emphasized.



ASSIGNMENT : ELLIPTIC CURVE[Assignment Elliptic Curve.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Cryptography/files/7598466/Assignment.Elliptic.Curve.pdf)

1.  Given 
                  E: y^2 = X^3 + x + 6
    Generate all the points in E(F_11).
  
2.  Elliptic Curve defined E: y^2 = X^3 + 22x + 25. Points P_1 = (1,1) and P_2 = (25,28) satisfy the equation   
    E(F_47). Find P_3.
    
3.  Alice and Bob agree to use elliptic Diffie-Hellmen key exchange with the prime, eliptic curve and point 
                           p = 47, E: y^2 = x^3 + 22x + 25, P = (30,7) is in E(F_47)
    show encryption and decryption process for message m = (3,27).
    
4.  Make a comparison between ECC and RSA. List at least 3 good and bad things for ECC and RSA.
